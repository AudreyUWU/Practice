    <h3>My Favorite Books</h3>
    <p>I love to read. As a reader I have fallen in love with many books. One of my favorite book series is the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling. I also love the Eragon series by Christopher Paolini. Other loves have come and gone such as The Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins and the Divergent trilogy by Veronica Roth. Lately, I have been trying to read more classic works of literature.</p>
    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
    <p>I have several commitments. These include Robotics (which is more of a deep, burning, passion than a hobby), reading (another deep passion), friendship bracelet making, ballet, tap, crocheting, embroidery, and I sometimes am able to set aside time to work on the quilt I've been making for ages.</p>
    <h3>My Ambitions</h3>
    <p>I am a naturally amitious person. My biggest goal right now is to be valedictorian at my high school. I also dream of one day programming robot probes for NASA or a similar company.</p>
